TODO: Parse the HTML document to scrape the stats off a page


Name all of the events in a hand-picked list

Look up event (possibly using a search of the name)
    - Specifically looking for the match ID number

    Parse the event to get links to each of the games
        -Links may have a very specific format, should be easy to find them with regex parsing

        For each game link, parse the HTML doc to get stats
            - Format stats and send to DB for storage
            - Log summary stats at the end of processing to show progress
        
            - Wait 30 seconds before moving to another page
