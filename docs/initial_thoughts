TODO: Parse the HTML document to scrape the stats off a page


Name all of the events in a hand-picked list

For all outgoing requests, I need to try to make it as "human-like" as possible, so I don't get blacklisted. This will require spoofing the headers to more or less match my Chrome browser, and to vary the time spent on each page (maybe normal distribution around 1min?)

Look up event (possibly using a search of the name)
    - Specifically looking for the match ID number

    Parse the event to get links to each of the games
        -Links may have a very specific format, should be easy to find them with regex parsing

        For each game link, parse the HTML doc to get stats
            - Format stats and send to DB for storage
            - Log summary stats at the end of processing to show progress
        
            - Wait 30 seconds before moving to another page



What stats am I trying to pull out of the matches?
Round-level data:
    Player-level data:
        player_name, agent, combat_score, kills, assists, death, money_start, money_spent, gun, shield

    Team-level data:
        team_name, money_start, money_spent, win_type, round_win



Much of the data will be in text format, so I will have to build mappings to more easibly reference items/players/shield levels
